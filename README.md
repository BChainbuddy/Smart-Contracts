# Solidity

Solidity is an Object Oriented Programming Laungage used to write smart contracts on Ethereum Blockchain.

<h2>What is a smart contract ?</h2>
<p>Smart contract is a piece of code which contains in itself business logic or a set of rules/logic. It is deployed on top of blockchains like ethereum, solana, and few more L1 blockchain. Ethereum can run smart contracts written in solidity laungage.</p>
<h2>What is a Dapp ?</h2>
<p>Dapp : Decenrtralized application is very similar to a web app but. Both have a slight difference in backend and deployment. Dapp have its backend built using solidity, and it is hosted/deployed on ethereum mainnet/testnet.</p>
<h3>Practice-Compile-test-deploy smart contracts on : <code>https://remix.ethereum.org/</code></h3>
<p>Once you make your smart contract in remix IDE, you will have to deploy it on the test network of ethereum or the a local blockchain provided by remix.</p>
<h3>Here is the list of networks and their configuration.</h3>
