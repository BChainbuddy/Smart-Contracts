# Solidity

Solidity is an Object Oriented Programming Laungage used to write smart contracts on Ethereum Blockchain.

<h2>What is a smart contract ?</h2>
<p>Smart contract is a piece of code which contains in itself business logic or a set of rules/logic. It is deployed on top of blockchains like ethereum, solana, and few more L1 blockchain. Ethereum can run smart contracts written in solidity laungage.</p>
<h2>What is a Dapp ?</h2>
<p>Dapp : Decenrtralized application is very similar to a web app but. Both have a slight difference in backend and deployment. Dapp have its backend built using solidity, and it is hosted/deployed on ethereum mainnet/testnet.</p>
<h3>Practice-Compile-test-deploy smart contracts on : <code>https://remix.ethereum.org/</code></h3>
<p>Once you make your smart contract in remix IDE, you will have to deploy it on the test network of ethereum or the a local blockchain provided by remix.</p>
<h3>Here is the list of networks and their configuration.</h3>

| Networks	    |RPC Url        | Chain ID      | Symbol        | Explorer |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Main Network	|https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/ | 1 | ETH | 	https://etherscan.io |
| Ropsten Test Network |	https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/ |	3 |	RopstenETH |	https://ropsten.etherscan.io |
| Rinkby Test Network	| https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/	| 4	| RinkebyETH	| https://rinkeby.etherscan.io |
| Goerli Test Network	| https://goerli.infura.io/v3/ |	5	| GoerliETH	| https://goerli.etherscan.io |
| Kovan Test Network |	https://kovan.infura.io/v3/	| 42 |	KovanETH |	https://kovan.etherscan.io |
| Localhost Test Network |	http://localhost:<PORT> | ID |TestEth	 | -Local Blockchain- |

If you are wondering where to get these test ethers you can visit different faucets where you will get these test ethers to work with such as 

1. https://faucet.metamask.io/

2. https://faucet.rinkeby.io/

3. https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/ 

Getting test ethers from these sites is not easy as you will get limited ethereum per day but those are plenty for testing purposes. If you want ethers in large amount you should use local test network such as Ganache which is very fast and effecient to use than other test networks.
