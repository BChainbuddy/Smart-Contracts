<h1>About Contract Inheriatnce</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is a method to extend the methods/functions and variables of a smart contract to another</li>
<li>Increases the reusability of code</li>
<li>Reduces code repetation</li>
</ul>
<p>Solidity supports inheritance between smart contracts, where multiple contracts can be inherited into a single contract. The contract from which other contracts inherit features is known as a base contract, while the contract which inherits the features is called a derived contract. Simply, they are referred to as parent-child contracts.</p>
